# Eleventh Embodiment

Main purpose of this project was to build a website for my First Milestone Project as a part of Full Stack Web Developer Diploma course, using knowldge of HTML and CSS only.
I have decided to build a website for a friend who is a yoga teacher and an alternative healer. Idea was to create a place where people can learn about different types of yoga, 
different healing techniques, and to be able to book yoga or healing sessions, workshop and retreats.
Website owner's goal is to attract more visitiors to the website wich will result in bigger community, larger following on social media, and ultimately more people booking her classes, healing seassions or retreats.  
## UX
 
Idea was to create a website that will be easy to navigate so that user can quickly find what they are looking for, but also to have a space that serves as a community of likeminded people who often socialise, prcatice together and help eachother. 


#### As a first time user,
* I want to be able to  navigate through the site easily to find information and services available
* I want to learn more about the site owner and their skills 
* I want to be able to see this website clearly on my mobile device
* I want to find ways to follow the owner on social media platforms


#### Returning User
  As a returning user
* I want to check if there are any new classes and/or retreats 
* I want to book online classes and/or retreats 
* I want to contact the owner to find out more information about their services

#### Frequent User
  As a Frequent user
* I want to see if there are any new upcoming events
* I want to sign up to the newsletter to get latest news and offers/discounts

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
